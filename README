I used Groovy to develop my B+ Tree. The project deploys via Maven and requires Maven > 3.2.5 and Java 1.7. You do not need to install Groovy, Maven will download it for you.

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Make sure you have Java 1.7 installed (untested with Java 1.8), and JAVA_HOME is set properly
2. Make sure you have Maven installed (Version > 3.2.5 should work) and M2_HOME set properly
3. Clone the Git repo into hw2_0867753

git clone https://github.com/zeebo404/btree.git hw2_0867753

4. Change into the directory

cd hw2_0867753

5. Compile the project

mvn compile

6. Execute the program. Program reads from standard in. You can pipe any input files in that way. Your input file should end with a blank line.

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=edu.zeebo.sp15.cosc6340.btree.Driver -Dexec.args="-f <inputFilename>"
